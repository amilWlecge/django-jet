## How to Install and Activate the Plugin
  
To install Dear Reality - dearVR Pro v1.2.0, you need to download the plugin from the Plugin Alliance website[^1^]. You can choose between AAX, VST3, VST or AU formats depending on your DAW. The plugin supports Windows 7 or higher (64-bit) and Mac OS X 10.9 or higher (64-bit).

## How to Use the 3D Spatializer to Position and Move Audio Sources
  
Once you have installed and activated the plugin, you can insert it on any audio track in your DAW. The plugin interface consists of four main sections: Spatializer, Room, Output and Settings.
  
The Spatializer section is where you can position and move audio sources in a 3D soundstage using a graphical XYZ-pad or separate sliders for azimuth, elevation and distance. You can also use automation to create dynamic movements of sounds.
  
To position a sound source using the XYZ-pad, simply drag your mouse around the pad until you find the desired location. The pad shows a top-down view of the soundstage with the listener in the center. You can also use the mouse wheel or the zoom buttons to change the scale of the pad.
  
To position a sound source using the sliders, simply adjust the values for azimuth, elevation and distance until you find the desired location. The azimuth slider controls the horizontal angle of the sound source relative to the listener's front direction (0Ã‚Â°). The elevation slider controls the vertical angle of the sound source relative to the listener's ear level (0Ã‚Â°). The distance slider controls how far away the sound source is from the listener (in meters).

## How to Select and Customize Virtual Acoustic Environments
  
The Room section is where you can select and customize virtual acoustic environments for your sounds. You can choose from 46 realistic presets that simulate different types of spaces such as concert halls, car interiors, rooms, churches, cellars, staircases, bathrooms, booths, warehouses, arenas, outdoor streets and live stages.
  
To select a preset, simply click on the drop-down menu and browse through the categories and subcategories until you find the one that suits your needs. You can also use the arrow buttons or the mouse wheel to scroll through the presets.
  
To customize a preset, you can use the sliders for Size, Absorption and Reflections. The Size slider controls how big or small the virtual space is (in meters). The Absorption slider controls how much sound energy is absorbed by the walls of the virtual space (in dB). The Reflections slider controls how much sound energy is reflected
