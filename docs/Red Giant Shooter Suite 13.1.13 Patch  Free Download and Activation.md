To use Red Giant Shooter Suite, you need to install it on your computer and activate it with the code provided. You can then access the tools from your video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects or Final Cut Pro. Each tool has its own interface and settings that you can customize according to your needs.
 
For example, to use Frames 1.1, you can drag and drop the effect onto your footage in the timeline, and then adjust the parameters in the effect controls panel. You can choose the output frame rate, the deinterlacing method, the motion detection and the quality settings. You can also preview the results in the program monitor.
 
To use Instant 4K, you can select your footage in the project panel, right-click and choose Red Giant > Instant 4K. You can then choose a preset or enter a custom resolution for your output. You can also adjust the quality and sharpening settings. Instant 4K will create a new sequence with your footage scaled up to the desired resolution.
 
To use Offload 1.0, you can launch the standalone application from your start menu or applications folder. You can then connect your camera or card reader to your computer and select it as the source. You can also choose a destination folder for your backup and an optional secondary destination for redundancy. Offload will scan your source for media files and display them in a list. You can then click Start to begin the transfer process.
 
To use PluralEyes 4.1\*, you can either launch it as a standalone application or as an extension within Premiere Pro. You can then import your video and audio clips into PluralEyes and arrange them on a timeline. You can also sync them by timecode, waveform or markers if available. PluralEyes will analyze your clips and sync them automatically. You can then export your synced timeline back to Premiere Pro or another editing software.
