Billa is not just a remake of a Tamil film, but also a tribute to the original Hindi film Don, which starred Amitabh Bachchan in the title role. The film features several references and homages to the classic film, such as the dialogue "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai" (It is not just difficult to catch Don, it is impossible), the song "Khaike Paan Banaraswala" and the twist ending. The film also pays respect to Krishnam Raju, who played the role of Billa in the 1980 Telugu remake of Don. Krishnam Raju appears in a cameo role as Billa's father in the film.
 
Billa also boasts of a stellar soundtrack composed by Mani Sharma, who is known for his work in Telugu and Tamil cinema. The film features six songs, which are sung by prominent singers like Shreya Ghoshal, Ranjith, Naveen Madhav and Hemachandra. The songs range from romantic duets like "Bommali" and "Ne Pattasu" to peppy numbers like "My Name is Billa" and "Ellora Shilpanni". The songs are also well-choreographed and picturized, adding to the appeal of the film.
