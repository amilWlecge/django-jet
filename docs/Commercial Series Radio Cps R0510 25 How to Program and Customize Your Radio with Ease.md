## Step 1: Download and Install the CPS
 
The Commercial Series Radio CPS R0510 25 is available on the Motorola Online website. You will need a valid account and password to access the site. Once you log in, go to the Software Downloads section and look for the Commercial Series Radio CPS R0510 25 link. Click on it and follow the instructions to download and save the file on your computer. The file size is about 200 MB, so it may take some time depending on your internet speed.
 
After downloading the file, locate it on your computer and double-click on it to start the installation process. You will need to accept the license agreement and choose a destination folder for the software. The installation wizard will guide you through the rest of the steps. Once the installation is complete, you will see a shortcut icon on your desktop for the CPS.
 
## Step 2: Register the EID for 25 kHz Operation
 
The Commercial Series Radio CPS R0510 25 requires an EID to enable 25 kHz operation on your radio. The EID is a code that you need to enter in the CPS to unlock this feature. You can obtain an EID from Motorola by taking a short online course on narrowbanding and passing a quiz. The course is free and takes about 15 minutes to complete.
 
To access the course, go to [https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en\_us/support/narrowbanding.html](https://www.motorolasolutions.com/en_us/support/narrowbanding.html) and click on the "Take Course" button. You will need to register with your name, email address, and phone number. After completing the registration, you will be able to start the course. The course consists of four modules that explain what narrowbanding is, why it is important, how it affects your radio, and how to program your radio with the CPS. At the end of each module, there is a quiz that you need to pass with at least 80% accuracy.
 
After passing all four quizzes, you will receive an email from Motorola with your EID code. You will need this code to register your CPS for 25 kHz operation.
 
## Step 3: Program Your Radio with the CPS
 
Now that you have installed the CPS and obtained your EID, you are ready to program your radio with 12.5 kHz channel spacing. To do this, you will need a programming cable that connects your radio to your computer. You can purchase this cable from Motorola or any authorized dealer.
