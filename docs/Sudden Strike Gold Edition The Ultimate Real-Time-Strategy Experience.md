- Use the pause function to plan your moves and issue orders. You can pause the game by pressing the spacebar or clicking on the pause button on the top right corner of the screen.
- Use the terrain to your advantage. Hide your units behind trees, buildings and hills to avoid enemy fire and ambush them. You can also destroy bridges, roads and railways to slow down or stop enemy movements.
- Use different types of units for different situations. Infantry are good for scouting, capturing buildings and objectives, and fighting in urban areas. Tanks are good for breaking through enemy lines and engaging other armored vehicles. Artillery and aircraft are good for providing fire support and bombing enemy positions.
- Keep an eye on your supply lines. Your units need fuel, ammo and repairs to keep fighting. You can resupply them by using trucks, trains or air drops. You can also capture enemy supply depots and vehicles to replenish your resources.
- Save your game often. The game can be challenging and unpredictable, so you might want to save your progress before making a risky move or facing a tough enemy. You can save your game by pressing F5 or clicking on the save button on the top left corner of the screen.
