For example, let's say you want to create a configurator for a custom bike. You can use Autodesk Inventor or Fusion 360 to design the bike frame, wheels, handlebars, seat, pedals, gears, brakes, and other components. You can also add different colors and finishes to each part of the bike.
 
## Step 2: Upload your model to Configurator 360 2012 and define the parameters and options that you want to offer to your customers
 
The next step is to upload your model to Configurator 360 2012 and define the parameters and options that you want to offer to your customers. Configurator 360 2012 is a cloud-based service that allows you to create and manage online configurators for your products. You can access Configurator 360 2012 from any web browser and upload your models from Autodesk Inventor or Fusion 360 directly.
 
Once you upload your model, you can use the Configurator Editor tool to define the parameters and options that you want to expose to your customers. Parameters are variables that control the dimensions, features, or behaviors of your product. Options are choices that you provide to your customers based on the parameters. For example, for the bike configurator, you can define parameters such as frame size, wheel size, gear type, brake type, etc. and options such as small, medium, large, mountain bike wheels, road bike wheels, single speed gear, multi speed gear, disc brakes, caliper brakes, etc.
 
You can also set rules and constraints for the parameters and options to ensure that only valid combinations are allowed. For example, you can set a rule that only disc brakes are available for mountain bike wheels. You can also set prices for each option and calculate the total price of the customized product based on the customer's selections.
 
## Step 3: Publish your configurator online and share it with your customers or embed it on your website
 
The final step is to publish your configurator online and share it with your customers or embed it on your website. Configurator 360 2012 provides you with a unique URL for each configurator that you create. You can use this URL to share your configurator with your customers via email, social media, or other channels. You can also embed your configurator on your website using an iframe code that Configurator 360 2012 generates for you.
 
When your customers access your configurator online, they can see a realistic 3D view of your product and interact with it using their mouse or touch screen. They can also customize their product by selecting the options that they want from a user-friendly interface. They can see the changes reflected on the product in real time and view the updated price as they make their selections. They can also rotate, zoom, pan, or explode
