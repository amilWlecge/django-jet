One of the books that covers the basic concepts of soft computing is *Principles of Soft Computing* by Dr S N Sivanandam and Dr S N Deepa. The book was published by Wiley India Pvt. Limited in 2007 and has 762 pages. The book is meant for a wide range of readers who wish to learn the basic concepts of soft computing[^1^].
 
The book is divided into four parts: Part I introduces the fundamentals of soft computing, Part II covers neural networks, Part III covers fuzzy logic, and Part IV covers genetic algorithms. Each part has several chapters that explain the theory and applications of the respective techniques. The book also includes a CD that contains MATLAB codes and examples for the readers to practice.
 
The book is well-written and easy to understand. The authors have used examples, diagrams, tables, and algorithms to illustrate the concepts. The book also provides exercises and review questions at the end of each chapter to test the understanding of the readers. The book covers a wide range of topics such as artificial intelligence, pattern recognition, control systems, image processing, data mining, and database security.
 
The book is available online as a PDF file for free download[^2^] [^3^]. However, some pages may not be available or readable due to copyright issues. The readers are advised to buy the original book from the publisher or a reliable source if they want to access the complete content.

*Principles of Soft Computing* by Sivanandam and Deepa is a comprehensive and useful book for anyone who wants to learn about soft computing. It provides a solid foundation for further study and research in this field.
  
Some of the advantages of soft computing are that it can handle uncertainty, imprecision, and vagueness in the data and the problem domain. It can also adapt to changing environments and learn from experience. Soft computing can provide approximate and optimal solutions to problems that are difficult or impossible to solve by conventional methods.
 
Some of the challenges of soft computing are that it may require a large amount of data and computational resources to train and test the models. It may also lack interpretability and transparency in the results and the decision-making process. Soft computing may also face ethical and social issues such as privacy, security, and bias.
 
Soft computing is a rapidly evolving and expanding field that has many applications and opportunities in various domains. It is expected to play a key role in the development of artificial intelligence and smart systems in the future. Soft computing can also enhance human capabilities and improve the quality of life.
