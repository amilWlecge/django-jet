The book is divided into 12 chapters, each covering a specific topic in electronics. The first chapter introduces the basic concepts of electronics, such as voltage, current, resistance, power, and energy. The second chapter deals with semiconductor diodes and their characteristics, applications, and models. The third chapter discusses bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) and their operation modes, configurations, biasing methods, and small signal analysis. The fourth chapter covers field effect transistors (FETs) and their types, characteristics, biasing methods, and small signal analysis. The fifth chapter explains the principles of amplifiers and their classification, frequency response, feedback, and stability. The sixth chapter describes the working of oscillators and their types, frequency stability, and design methods. The seventh chapter focuses on filters and their types, frequency response, and design methods. The eighth chapter introduces the basics of digital electronics, such as number systems, codes, logic gates, Boolean algebra, and simplification methods. The ninth chapter explains the operation of combinational circuits, such as adders, subtractors, encoders, decoders, multiplexers, demultiplexers, comparators, and parity generators. The tenth chapter deals with sequential circuits, such as flip-flops, counters, registers, shift registers, and memory devices. The eleventh chapter covers analog to digital (A/D) and digital to analog (D/A) converters and their types, specifications, and applications. The twelfth chapter discusses some special topics in electronics, such as optoelectronics devices (LEDs), integrated circuits (ICs), operational amplifiers (op-amps), timers (555), voltage regulators (78XX), and power supplies.
