## What is Applied Economics?
 
Applied economics is a branch of economics that uses economic theory and empirical methods to analyze and solve real-world problems. Applied economics can be applied to various fields, such as business, finance, health, education, environment, and social issues. Applied economics can help policymakers, managers, entrepreneurs, and consumers make better decisions and improve their outcomes.
 
Applied economics differs from pure economics, which is more concerned with developing abstract models and theories to explain how the economy works. Pure economics is also known as theoretical economics or positive economics. Applied economics, on the other hand, is also known as empirical economics or normative economics. Applied economics tests the validity of economic theories using data and evidence, and provides recommendations and solutions based on the results.
