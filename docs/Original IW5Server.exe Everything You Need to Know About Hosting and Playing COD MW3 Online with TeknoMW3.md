If you are trying to play Spec Ops with a friend in Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3, you may encounter the "wrong protocol version" error. This means that your game version is different from your friend's game version. The current version of the game is 1.9.463, but some players may have 1.9.461 or lower.

One possible solution to this problem is to replace the iw5sp.exe file in your game folder with the original iw5sp.exe file from the latest update. The iw5sp.exe file is the executable file that runs the single-player and Spec Ops modes of the game. You can find this file in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3[^4^].
 
To replace the iw5sp.exe file, you need to copy it from someone who has the latest version of the game, or download it from a trusted source online. You can use a USB flash drive, an email attachment, or a file-sharing service to transfer the file. Make sure you backup your original iw5sp.exe file before you overwrite it with the new one.
 
Once you have the original iw5sp.exe file, paste it into your game folder and overwrite the existing one. Then, restart your game and try to connect with your friend again. You should be able to play Spec Ops without any errors.
 
Note: This solution only works for the iw5sp.exe file, not the iw5mp.exe file, which is the executable file for the multiplayer mode of the game. If you have problems with the multiplayer mode, you may need to verify your game cache or reinstall your game.
  
Why do some players have different versions of the game? The reason may be that some players have not updated their game to the latest version, or that they have modified their game files in some way. For example, some players may use custom skins, maps, or mods that change the game files. These modifications may cause compatibility issues with other players who have the original game files.
 
How can I update my game to the latest version? The easiest way to update your game is to use Steam, which automatically downloads and installs the latest updates for your games. To check if your game is up to date, you can right-click on the game in your Steam library, select Properties, and go to the Updates tab. There, you can see the current version of your game and the last time it was updated. You can also choose to always keep your game updated or only update it when you launch it.
 
How can I avoid modifying my game files? If you want to play Spec Ops with your friends without any errors, you should avoid using any custom skins, maps, or mods that alter your game files. These modifications may not only cause compatibility issues, but also violate the terms of service of the game and result in a ban. If you have already modified your game files, you should restore them to their original state by verifying your game cache or reinstalling your game.
